# XPath Challenge

## Setup

## Part 1
Open `easy.html`.  
It's a pretty simple html page which follows the [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/)  
Which `XPath` expression can we use to extract `Open Graph title`?

## Part 2
Open `hard.html`.  
We want to extract the same property as in `easy.html` but it doesn't exist.  
In this case (if opengraph title doesn't exist), extracted text should be just `Doe`.
